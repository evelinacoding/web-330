            <p class="about">At the intersection of art and technology, I am an expert artist web developer. My goal is to help artists bring their creative visions to life online. I work with a variety of platforms and tools to design and develop websites that are both engaging and functional. From custom graphics to intuitive user interfaces, every aspect of your website will be tailored to your individual style. Whether you're looking to sell art online or simply share your work with the world, I'm here to help.</p>
            <p class="about">Growing up I always loved to participate in anything that was even remotely artistic. One of my favorite past-times is DIY. I've done many artistic things throughout my life such as painting, drawing, cosplay, weaving, sewing, writing, and more. My current favorite past time is painting with pastels, particularly watermelons. I have an obsession with vibrant colors. I graduated from Cal State Long Beach with a major in Studio Art which is something that I think will definitely help me on my quest to become a web developer.</p>
